# Hi, I'm Akash C R 👋

I’m a Machine Learning Engineer with a background in Electronics & Communication Engineering.
I enjoy building AI-driven solutions that solve real-world problems, especially in agriculture,
healthcare, and industrial systems.

I work at the intersection of **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Python**,
with hands-on experience in end-to-end ML projects — from data preprocessing to deployment.
